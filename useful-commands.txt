Please find below some useful commands that can be used during the workshop:
1. To start the docker with sample application:
   docker run -d --name SampleBankApp -p 4000:3000 nikhilgoenka/sample-bank-app
   This would start the docker on port localhost:4000 with docker name as "SampleBankApp"
   
2. To start the jenkins docker:
   docker run -d --name Jenkins-Dynatrace -p 8020:8080  -v /var/jenkins:/var/jenkins_home -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock nikhilgoenka/jenkins-dynatrace-workshop
   -d runs the docker in daemon mode.
   -p 8020:8080 - By default, jenkins docker would be running on 8080. Specifying -p 8020:8080 binds the 8080 in docker to localhost on 8020. So, you can forward/listen requests from
                  docker using localhost:8020.
3. -v Bind mounts a volume.
    By default, jenkins docker is maintaining the pipeline/data information in /var/jenkins_home. Specifying "-v /var/jenkins:/var/jenkins_home" would mount the localhost:/var/jenkins
    directory so that the pipeline data is not lost once pipeline is re-started.
    Specifying '-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock' will allow the jekins docker to leverage the dockerd running on localhost. This would be required since we are starting the
    sample-app dockers while running the pipeline.

4. To run the ansible-tower docker:
   docker run -d --name ansible-tower -p 8090:443 ybalt/ansible-tower
   This would start the docker on port localhost:8090 with docker name as "ansible-tower"

Other useful commands:
1. To view the downloaded images on localhost: docker images
2. To remove a particular image: docker rmi <IMAGE-NAME>
3. To stop a docker: docker stop <CONTAINER-ID>
4. To remove a docker: docker rm <CONTAINER-ID>
5. To run a docker in interactive bash: docker run -it <CONTAINER> /bin/bash
6. To delete all the unused images: docker system prune -a -f
7. To pull a particular image: docker pull <docker-image>
8. To run load test using JMETER, 
   Run: jmeter -n -t [jmx file] -l [results file] -e -o [Path to web report folder]
9. Jenkins pipeline:
